# CS479/579 Reverse Engineering at NMSU
**Summary Section** <br>
This repo will hold my reports on reverse engineering malware.
<br>
<br>
**System Setup Section** <br>
1. To set up my reverse engineering system I first had to create a drive that would allow my computer to boot up Linux. I downloaded Rufus and then installed Linux on to a flashdrive. I then needed to get VirtualBox and the Windows iso that I was going to use. Since for some reason my web browsers didn't work I had to download them from command lines. The last thing that I did was is connect the network capabilites of the virtual device.
2. We are using isolation to prevent the malware that we are using to escape our controled virtual environment.
3.
